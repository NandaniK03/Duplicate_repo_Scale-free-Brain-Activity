**Spectral Slope**

* Average slope value increased through NREM sleep stages.

* Average slope value oberved to be highest in N3 state.

* REM sleep state closely resembles wake sleep state, both presenting the lowest slope values.

* Average slope value observed to be relatively lower in meditators compared to controls

**Intercept**

* Intercept and Exponent were found to be positively correlated.

* Lowest intercept values observed in wake state and highest in N3 state.

* Intercept values observed to be relatively lower in meditators compared to controls

**Topography**
 
* Average spectral slope value observed to be the lowest in the central recording regions.

* Intercept observed to be relatively higher in the anterior recording regions and lowest in the central recording regions.
